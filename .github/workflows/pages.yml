name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# NOTE: This workflow is currently disabled because the project has dependencies
# (context-read, ngrams, context-trace) that use tokio and other non-wasm-compatible
# crates unconditionally. To enable wasm builds, these crates need to be updated to:
# 1. Make tokio and mio dependencies conditional with cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))
# 2. Or provide wasm-compatible alternatives for async runtime
#
# See context-engine/crates/*/Cargo.toml for the changes needed.
