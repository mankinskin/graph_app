# No Imports Workspace Fixture

## Overview
This fixture tests the edge case where the target crate has no imports from the source crate. It validates that the refactoring tool handles "nothing to do" scenarios gracefully without breaking either crate.

## Structure
```
no_imports_workspace/
├── Cargo.toml (workspace manifest)
├── source_crate/
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       └── lib.rs (basic source functionality)
└── dummy_target/
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src/
        └── lib.rs (independent functionality)
```

## Source Crate Features
- **Public Function**: `source_function()` - basic functionality
- **Public Struct**: `SourceConfig` - simple configuration struct
- **Public Constant**: `SOURCE_CONSTANT` - numerical constant
- **Independence**: Contains functionality that could be imported but isn't

## Target Crate Features
- **Public Function**: `local_function()` - completely independent functionality
- **Public Struct**: `LocalConfig` - independent configuration struct  
- **No Dependencies**: Does not import anything from the source crate
- **Self-contained**: All functionality is implemented locally

## Test Cases Using This Fixture

### `test_no_imports_scenario()`
- **Purpose**: Tests the refactoring tool's behavior when there are no imports to refactor
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Tool should complete gracefully (either succeed with no changes or fail gracefully)
  - Source crate should remain unchanged (no new exports added)
  - Target crate should remain unchanged
  - Both crates should continue to compile successfully
- **Validates**:
  - Edge case handling
  - Tool robustness with empty input
  - Preservation of existing code when no work is needed

## Expected Changes After Refactoring
- **Source Crate**: No changes expected (no new `pub use` statements)
- **Target Crate**: No changes expected (already has no imports)
- **Exports**: Empty list (no items should be exported)
- **Wildcards**: 0 expected (no wildcard imports should be created)

## Compilation Requirements
- **Edition**: 2021
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Features**: None

## Edge Case Scenarios
This fixture tests several important edge cases:

1. **Empty Input**: What happens when there are no imports to process
2. **Tool Robustness**: Whether the tool can handle "nothing to do" gracefully
3. **Preservation**: Ensuring existing code is not modified when no work is needed
4. **Error Handling**: Testing that the tool doesn't crash on empty input

## Acceptable Behaviors
The test accepts two possible behaviors from the refactoring tool:

1. **Success with No Changes**: Tool reports success but makes no modifications
2. **Graceful Failure**: Tool reports that there's nothing to refactor

Both behaviors are considered acceptable as long as:
- Neither crate is broken or modified inappropriately
- Both crates continue to compile
- No false positive changes are made

## Notes
- This fixture validates the tool's robustness and error handling
- Tests that the tool doesn't make unnecessary changes
- Ensures the tool can handle edge cases without crashing
- Validates that "no work needed" is handled appropriately
- Both success and failure are acceptable outcomes for this scenario
