ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present a comprehensive mathematical analysis of the hallucination phenomenon in generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models. We rigorously define and measure hallucination and creativity using concepts from probability theory and information theory. By introducing a parametric family of GPT models, we characterize the trade-off between hallucination and creativity and identify an optimal balance that maximizes model performance across various tasks. Our work offers a novel mathematical framework for understanding the origins and implications of hallucination in GPT models and paves the way for future research and development in the field of large language models (LLMs).},

    abstract = "It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation. In this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive document summarization and found that these models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a large scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive summarization systems to better understand the types of hallucinations they produce. Our human annotators found substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that pretrained models are better summarizers not only in terms of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in generating faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans. Furthermore, we show that textual entailment measures better correlate with faithfulness than standard metrics, potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation metrics as well as training and decoding criteria.",
