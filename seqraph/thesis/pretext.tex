The recent advances in expressive power of natural language models, driven by the attention mechanism in the transformer model, have raised new awareness for the risks associated with natural language processing at a large scale. In this paper we are eluding to the need for human controllable natural language models and devise a new concept for a language model based on a compressed substring relation in a given corpus. We describe how the resulting structure could be used as a language model where causal explanations for its predictions can be derived, model structure can accurately be modified and filtered in the fine-tuning stage. We provide a definition of the model and describe an algorithm for inducing the compressed structure from a raw string corpus in an incremental procedure.
